        <h1>Reason</h1>
        <div class= "line"></div>
        <p>The first reason why I like reading books is because when I read fiction books, they are quite fun and exciting to read. Most of the time, the fiction books are quite unpredictible as they are thrilling and entertaing every page. The second reason why I like books are because in non-fiction books, the books are very knowledgeable and inspirational. And the last reason is because they keep me away from the internet. During these COVID-19 time, we are using our computers much more than before, and this take a lot of strain in our eyes. So when I am reading books, they also rest my eyes.</p>
